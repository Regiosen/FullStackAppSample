# FullStackAppSample
<div>This project contains both the front end and the backend of an application that modifies a database of students.
To properly execute this application in local, the backend of the application must be run first:</div>
<div>Open the "FullStackAppSample" folder in visual studio and execute it</div>
Once the backend is running, the front end part of the applicacion must be executed:
<div>Open the "FullStackAppSampleFronted" with the console and execute ng serve</div>
<div>Navigate to localhost:4200</div>
<div>Once this is done the application should be running, if it isn't, contact me at regiosen@gmail.com</div>
